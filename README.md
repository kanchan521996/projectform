# Flask HTML Web & Database Project Starter

This is a starter project for you to use to start your Flask HTML web & database
projects.

It contains quite a lot of example code. You can use this to see how the various
parts of the project work, or you can delete it and start from scratch.

## Setup

```shell


# Install dependencies and set up the virtual environment
; pipenv install

# Activate the virtual environment
; pipenv shell

# Install the virtual browser we will use for testing
; playwright install
# If you have problems with the above, contact your coach

# Create a test and development database
; createdb YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
; createdb YOUR_PROJECT_NAME_test

# Open lib/database_connection.py and change the database names
; open lib/database_connection.py

# Seed the development database (ensure you have run `pipenv shell` first)
; python seed_dev_database.py
  python3 seed_dev_database.py
# Run the tests (with extra logging)


pip install psychopg

; pytest -sv

# Run the app
; python app.py
# Now visit http://localhost:5001/emoji in your browser
```

If you would like to remove the example code:

```shell
; ./remove_example_code.sh
